# University-Network-Design-using-Packet-Tracer

* Using Cisco Packet Tracer, we have created a network for a standard univeristy. 
* The univeristy has 5 departments, namely- IT dept, Admin dept, Finance dept, Student block and Faculty block. 
* The university has its own private IP address of 172.16.0.0/12 range and has one border route which is connected to the ISP. The sites which can be accessed through the internet in the college are youtube.com and google.com. 
* The Faculty and Student blocks have been set up using DHCP method as there is a large number of users and the other departments have been assigned IP addresses statically.
